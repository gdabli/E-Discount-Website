When she served ours, she flung the plates at the table with such force that the bread literally came off the plates and fell onto the table. \n\nShe walks away as if nothing happens I have to almost scream to get her attention and call out that we would like new bread.\n\nWithout apologizing or saying a word, she takes the plate and returns with a \"New\" plate.\n\nThis is all before we have been waiting 15 minutes for water or even being asked what we would like to drink.\n\nI wish i had caught her name to post here, but if you see a short haired, brunette, older waitress with a heavy new england accent, run as fast as you possibly can out the door.\n\nAfter the bread, I told my family to get up and we left to eat down the street.

(Actually, we were married in the Martha-Mary Chapel, our reception was at the Inn.)  LWI is a historic landmark – and it’s non-profit! PajamaGal and I have dined at the Inn three times within the past two years.  “Disappointed” would be a term used to describe our previous visit and unfortunately, I wouldn’t raise that assessment for last night’s experience.  The Wayside Inn strikes me as a place where you pay for the atmosphere and not the food.  But to be fair, by the time we were finished (about 6:45), most of the seats in most of the rooms were filled.  And I’d venture to guess that the majority of the folks were locals. \n\nIt will probably be a while before we return – there are many places where I can spend less than $100 and get much better food.  This review’s Visit: 2014/01/28 – 5:30 P.M. Server: Carol (I think) – \n\nService was adequate, but unremarkable. \n\nStarters:\n\nFried Calamari .... $9.95\nSpicy dipping sauce and hot cherry peppers\n\nAs I’ve said before, Fried Calamari is my favorite appetizer. Carrabba’s version (and maybe romaine’s) is the standard against which I measure all others – and LWI’s version wasn’t even close. Two good things were (1) the portion was enough to share, and (2) the menu didn’t lie – those Cherry Peppers were HOT!  But the breading was soggy and the calamari was tough.   \n\nMain Dishes:\n\nSalmon Dijonnaise .... $21.95\nHerbed crusted fillet with a hint of mustard\n\nPajamaGal’s  second favorite dish is salmon.  She finished the sides (butternut squash and a baked potato) but brought half of the salmon home.  I did not taste it, and she replied, “OK” when I asked her how it was.\n\nTwin Fillets of Sole .... $22.95\n \nFilled with shrimp and crabmeat stuffing, lobster newburg sauce (sides were Butternut Squash and Delmonico Potatoes)\n\nWeak on taste, short on sauce.  If there were shrimp within the stuffing, they were shredded/processed too small to detect.  The stuffing reminded me of a over-breaded crab cake.  The sauce was very good, but there was too little of it (I didn’t ask for more; I mostly review what is served “as-is”.)  Without the sauce, there just wasn’t much flavor.\n\nThe squash and the Delmonico potatoes were also very good!\n\nDeserts:\n \nRustic Apple Pie a la Mode .... $3.95\nServed with our own caramel sauce Served in a bowl with a scoop of ice cream, PajamaGal ate every bite.\n", "time": 1390999592 }, { "aspects": [{ "rating": 0, "type": "food" }, { "rating": 2, "type": "decor" }, { "rating": 2, "type": "service" }], "author_name": "Diane Nesman", "author_url": "https://plus.google.com/107633527838239836166", "language": "en", "rating": 3, "text": "Great setting.

There was a 15 minute wait but it included a nice, tiny bar accessible at the front. It was packed and we stood admiring the several craft beers, noticing, they sell 64oz growlers and the what made my heart skip a beat, was the extensive whiskey list. Wishing we had a place to put our coats, I started with a sifter neat of Bully Boy White Whiskey. It was actually white, light and delightful. Within the 15 minutes we were seated right across from the wood fire oven and open kitchen. We started with garlic knots and grass fed beef meatballs: knots delicious, meatballs good and perfectly proportioned. Then we each got our own individuals pizzas: Margherita with sausage, mushroom & fontina, Wellfleet cherrystone clam & bacon. They were all perfectly cooked and decent sized for left overs. I also had another sifter neat of WhistlePig Straight Rye Whiskey and my friend had a Pretty Things. Total bill without first bar tab for 3 – $90.
